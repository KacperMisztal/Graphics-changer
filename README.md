# Graphics-changer
This program is an unofficial GUI for a command line tool called 'system76-graphics'. If you are using PopOS on a computer with hybrid graphics and change DE to something other than Gnome, you may encounter a problem with changing graphics modes. This tool enables you to change them easily. 
To run graphics-changer.py you need:
- Python3
- PySimpleGUI module for Python3
